- Focus on the entire market sector, not just an individual stock
- Markets are efficient, the price is mostly what the value of ths stock is, there are thousands of people looking and analyzing these stocks

- 25% is fundamental
- 25% is technical, i like stocks that has linearity to its trend, and not swinging all over the place
- Another 25% is watching how stock reacts to different information: macro event, news, and going to round numbers
  50,100. I like to see stock go higher on good news, and not lose much ground on bad news. If a stock reacts
  negatively to bad news, it has not been blessed
- Last 25% is looking at whole market sector as individual stock and gut feeling to where its heading
- I try to figure out what strategies are working in the market, one year it might be momentum, another year value
- We started seeing headlines about potential problems with Russia, you see these kind of news all the time, but this
  time the price was responding, so I felt convinced the situation would continue.
- Buy on extreme weakness, sell on extreme strength 
- When there is bad news, and market just shrugs it off, its a good bullish sign
- One time i was blindly bearish, because in the past higher interest rates led to lower stock prices, however this time
  the market chose to look at other factors
- Cut your losses quick, because rather than holding on to it and hoping for a bounce back, that money can be reinvested
  elsewhere to make the losses back
- Advices:
   > Listen to the market, not outside opinions
   > Think trades through, including exit points
   > Its a warning sign if market is not responding to data correctly
   > Recognize winners and losers fast
   > Start day from last nights close, not your original cost
   > Get rid of all distractions
   > Force yourself to buy on extreme weakness and sell on extreme strength

- Tektronix gas revenues of 2 billion and a market cap of 500 million, so in this case market cap is a fraction of the
  annual revenues, which indicates value
- What we short are unreasonable wallstreet expectations, not inferior companies
- This business is not about investing in great companies, but about profiting from inefficiently priced stocks
- If you short a stock when there is no news to warranty a decline, it could go against you. Therefore we have to time
  the short with some event, such as quarterly earnings. Some stocks have such unrealistic expectations that just
  meeting the expectations, the stock goes down, and if its disappointing, the stock plummets
- When i choose a stock, I look for market-adjusted decline of at least 50%. I say market-adjusted because if the market
  is down 50%, the stock being down 50% does not mean a thing. If market is down 10%, I want to see stock down 60%
-  I wait for market to create a pricing inefficiency. What gives you opportunity is a few major funds deciding that
   owning a stock is so stigmatizing that they dont want to be associated with it, they would rather sell their
   position at any price than having to answer for having that stock in their portfolio.
- For our screening, debt has to be manageable relative to cash flow. Stock has to be near or even under book value. I
  want to see share repurchase or insider buying. Value has to be extremely compelling, we use price to sales, cash
  flow, book value, and private market value which is the value at which it might be bought.

- The difference between our and others funds is that we spend a lot of time talking with CFOs and trying to find out
  information before everyone else
- We look for stocks trading for 8-12x PE ratio
- We look for insider buying with prospect for imminent change
- My fav company to short is a one-product company because if the product fails, there is nothing to fall back on
- You have to invest without emotions. You can’t be afraid to take a loss, people who are successful are willing to lose
  money.


# Dana Galante
---------------
- I used charts for market timing. Ex: if the stock i am short collapses to support, i will get out
- Support is just price areas that has witnessed a lot of buying in the past, points at which prices consolidated before
  moving higher
- I anticipate deterioration in earnings by looking for companies with high PE ratio but slowing revenue growth who have
  kept their earnings looking good by cutting expenses. Usually it’s only a matter of time earnings growth slows as
  well. Another is looking for a company that is doing great, but competitor is creeping up
- I wont short a stock moving straight up, stock has to show signs of weakening or at least stalling 
- If a company blames short sellers for its price, it’s a red flag. Another is a company that goes from its traditional
  business to whatever is hot at the time. Another is lots of management changes, also a change in auditors because the
  current auditors wont makeup the numbers to look good. High receivables is also another red flag
- Some other screens are: revenue deceleration, earnings deceleration, high PE, high inventories, stock breaking below
  their 50 day moving average
- A good company can be a bad stock and vice versa


# Michael Marcus
-----------------
- The best trades are the ones in which you have all 3 things going for you: fundamentals, technicals, market tone
- First, the fundamentals suggest that there is imbalance of supply and demand, which could result in a major move
- Second, the chart must show that market is moving in direction that fundamentals suggest
- Third, when the news comes out, the market should act in a way that reflects the right psychological tone. Ex: a bull
  market should shrug off bad news and respond vigorously to bullish news
- Trend following system approach doesn’t work anymore, because once you have defined a trend and taken a position,
  everyone else has taken position as well. Since there is no-one left to buy, the market swings around the other
  direction and gets you out
- Bet less than 5% of the portfolio in one idea. Always use stops to exit even before going into a trade
- High EPS with low P/E is the best combo


# Mark D. Cook

- I lost 500k selling naked calls, then i worked 14 hour days for 5 years to make it back. I could have declared
  bankruptcy but that would have been admitting defeat, so I did not do it, although it would have been the right
  business decision
- Never increase your position on a winning streak, otherwise you will have your largest position on a losing trade
- A trade i do is bond ratio trade. The bonds and S&P are like a couple. Bond market always leads, so its the female,
  and S&P, the male always follows the female. When couples first start to date, they don’t know each other, so they
  will be out of sync. Then they get engaged and relationships get closer, then they get married and go to honeymoon.
  During this honeymoon period, everything they do is synchronous, and when the bonds go up a few ticks, the S&P
  follows immediately . Then, after the honeymoon, bonds will drag the S&P along, but slower. Then, comes the divorce,
  and the bonds and S&P will move in exactly opposite directions. Everyday, I make a determination of what type of day
  it is.
- I no longer hold options for more than 3 days, its like holding an ice cube, the longer you hold the more it
  diminishes until its gone
- When the market is too oversold, its buying opportunity, but market needs a catalyst to turn around 
- One reason option premiums have gone up so much is due to explosion in volatility, prices depend upon both market
  price and volatility. Once volatility starts to ease, option prices don’t go up that much although there is increase
  in price
- You need to select a market that fits your personality because market is a reflection of people who trade it
- Trading has to be a vocation, not a hobby, because hobbies cost money
- If you have more knowledge, you can get away with less experience and vice-versa
- If you are feeling emotional or physical distress, you cannot focus, so its better to reduce or stop your trading

- I didn’t short Amazon. I sold out-of-the-money calls. Since the options I sold were way out-of-the money, the market
  could go up a lot and I still would not lose money. The stock was trading at 220, and I sold 250 calls. 
- Dont get involved when there is too much mania, because you can’t predict mania. If a stock that should be at 10$ is
  trading at 100$, then it can easily go to $200
- Margin of safety is buying a stock at $10 if you think its true value should be $15
- I pay close attention to insider trading, and stocks making new 52 week lows
- I also pay attention if a stock has been moving sideways but earnings have been moving higher 
- I sell puts(bullish) at prices that i am happy to own the stock myself. By selling puts, I am getting paid by the
  market while waiting for the stock to come down to my price
- Sometimes only way to make money js by selling puts. For example: during times when value stocks are out of favor,
  there are stocks trading at 5x earnings, earnings growing, insider buying, s&p soaring, but the stock goes nowhere.
  You can’t make money by buying stocks, you have to sell puts.
- In a bear market, all momentum players, hype players, growth players will get killed, only value players thrive,
  because the stocks I buy are already in bear market, 60-70% down from their highs. I just hold these stocks
  throughout bear market
- I buy companies that have good balance sheet, high book value, good management, and large insider buying. These
  businesses almost never go bankrupt 
- High profit margin can be a sign of weakness, because there is no room for further improvement 


# Mark Minervini
-----------------
- I cut losses quickly, if it goes beyond 10%
- God traders manage the downside, they don’t worry about the upside
- You can’t get beat if you have a great defense
- Take note of what happens to the stock when you sell it, and how to use that information in the future. If all the
  stocks you sell went up, then you should have kept it for longer, if a trade that you  buy/sell on Friday is not
  working, don’t trade on Fridays. Trading is about recognizing and rectifying how you think and act, which can be
  subconscious
- Chart patterns are only useful when you know when to apply them
- Most people prefer to forget their mistakes rather than learning from them, which is a big mistake.
- Have a contingency plan for every possible event, including how to get back to a trade, when to take profits


# Steve Lescarbeau
-------------------
- Systems have a lifespan, if too many people know it, market knows it, and its not going to work anymore 
- I hardly spend any time trading, over 99% of time I am doing research for the 1% of the time i trade


# Michael Masters
------------------
- We use technical analysis, not because it means something but because other people think it means something. Knowing
  technical points at which people might be buying/selling is helpful


# John Bender

- To make money in options, you don’t need to know what the price of stock is going to be, all you need to know is the
  probability distribution i.e, the probability of  stock being at different price levels at the time of options
  expiry
- A probability distribution is a curve showing probability of some event occurring, in this case, x axis shows price of
  the stock, and y-axis shows probability of stock being at different prices
- However, correct probability distribution is different for every market and every time period, its not always a normal
  distribution 
- The Black-Scholes model, if gold is trading at $400 assumes that probability of it trading at $360 a month from now is
  tremendously lower than it trading at $380. However, it might be more likely to trade at $360 than $385 due to stop
  loss, support levels etc, it implies opportunity because market is pricing options assuming price movements will be
  random.
- IBM was going up because people were dumping money into the market, and managers were buying IBM and other stocks
  because they had to invest the money somewhere. A market that is driven by inflows can have small corrections, but it
  has to then immediately recover to new highs to keep generating new money inflows. Otherwise, money inflows are
  likely to dry up, and the market will fall apart. Therefore, this type of market is likely to either trend higher or
  kreak sharply. There is a much smaller-than-normal chance that the market will go down 5 or 6 percent and stay there.
  Based on this assumption, last year I implemented an option strategy that would make a lot of money if the market
  went down big, make a little bit if the market went up small, and lose a small amount if the market went down small
  and stayed there. The market kept up its relentless move upward for the first half the year, and I made a small
  amount of money. Then the market had a correction and didn't recover right away; the next stop was down 20 percent. I
  made an enormous amount of money on that move.
- When someone tells people to buy a stock, there is a good chance they are telling you to buy what they want to sell
- Its not the current opinion on the stock that matters, its the potential change in the opinion.

# Claudio Guazzoni

- We don’t use fancy formulas, instead we look at CEOs and top management. We judge a person’s character, and ability to
  get himself out of a box, which is an inherent trait than an acquired skill
- ex: We look for person who would not cheat on their wives, if someone can cheat on their wives they can easily cheat
  on me
