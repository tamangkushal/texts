- He positions himself to be on the opposite side of the extreme reaction to a news ex: FED rate cut. If there is a massive sell-off, he buys and vice versa
- Wharton business aught you that 40% of a stock's price movement was due
to the market, 30% to the sector, and only 30% to the stock itself. I don't know if the percentages arc exactly correct, but conceptually the idea makes sense.
- If I am in a trade because of a catalyst, the first thing I check is
whether the catalyst still applies, if it does not I get out of the trade
- Most traders make money only in the 50-55%
range. That means you're going to he wrong a lot. If that's the case,
you better make sure your losses are as small as they can be, and that
your winners are bigger.
- A basic principle in going short is that there has to be a catalyst. Here,
the catalyst was the offering. The offering was on Friday, and I started
going short on Tuesday, so that I would be fully positioned by that
time. 
- Common mistake other traders make is that they short stocks because they are up, as if that were a reason. They'll say, "1 can't believe the stock is so high," and that's their total research. That makes no sense to me. My response is: "You have to do better than that." I have friends who get emotional about the market.
They fight it. Why put yourself in that position?
- The difference is that there was a catalyst. I knew the offering was
scheduled for Friday. I knew what was going on. I also knew what I
expected to happen. 
- I want my traders to know a lot about something, instead of a little about everything.
- I'm looking for people who are not afraid to take risks. One of the
questions I ask is: "Tell me some of the riskiest things you've ever
done in your life." I want guys who have the confidence to be out
there; to be risk takers.
- A lot of people get scared and think that since they made a lot of
money they'd better protect it. That's a very limiting philosophy. I am
just the opposite. I want to keep the firm growing. I have no interest
in retiring. Also, my traders teach me about their sectors. I'm always learn-
ing, which keeps it exciting and new. I'm not doing the same thing
that I was doing ten years ago. I have evolved and will continue to
evolve.
- The current long-running bull market will end badly; it always ends badly. Everybody in the world is talking stocks now. Everybody wants to be a trader. To me that is the sign of something ending, not something beginning. You can't
have everybody on one side of the fence. The world doesn't work
that way.
- You can't control what the market does, but you can control your reac-
tion to the market. I examine what I do all the time. That's what trad-
ing is all about.
- I put on trades for lots of different reasons. Sometimes I trade off the tape—the individual stock price action; sometimes I trade off the sector; and sometimes I trade based on a catalyst.
- **** The basic idea is that you trade your theory and then let the market tell you whether you are right. ****
- I hired a pyschiatrist, because kike athelets, traders also work in a highly competitive environment and are performance driven. I felt that the inability of some traders to achieve success was usually due to personal flaws rather than a con-
sequence of bad ideas versus good ideas. All traders have something
holding them back.

- One of the therapies for depressed and suicidal patients is to help them become more self-reliant and assertive. These same skills are applicable to athletes and traders as well.
- Different sports require different mental frameworks. For example, in bobsledding, you need to start off with a maximum amount of exertion as you run and push the sled. But as soon as you get into the sled, you have to slow down
your adrenaline so that you are calm and centered while steering the
sled down the course. A similar transition where the athletes race on cross-country skis, with their heart rate exceeding 120 beats per minute, and then have to stop and focus on shooting a target, with their heartbeat ideally slowing clown to 40
beats per minute. These types of athletes can condition themselves
by practicing abrupt mental shifts between exertion and relaxation.
- A sport like archery, however, the critical element is for the ath-
letes to be able to empty their minds, by relaxation and imagery. There are many techniques, but the essential idea is that you want to notice a thought and then let it go. For example, you might picture, the thought in a bubble and then visualize it lading off and disappearing.
- In any sport, it's very difficult to win a gold medal unless you decide
you're going to win it. Most people don'tbelieve it is possible and settle for not succeeding, or at least not succeeding at the level they have chosen. You have to be willing to put yourself on the line and go for it, even with the thought that you will feel humiliated if you don't make it after you have promised that you
would.
- Promised the world—that makes it much more powerful. Promising
the result commits you to doing it and leaves you no alternative but to
do it if you are going to live by your word. Letting others know that
you have set a goal and are committed to achieving it makes it more
likely you will achieve that goal.
- Steve Cohen set a target for this year that was off the charts. He
had to plan a strategy consistent with that target. He starts working at
four in the afternoon on Sunday and works until ten that night. "I
don't want to do that," he says, "but I have to in order to play at this
level. I don't want to come into the office at seven-thirty every morn-
ing. I don't want to go through all these charts every night. But it's
what I have to do if I'm going to be true to my goal."
- Believing that an outcome is possible makes it achievable. The classic example is Roger Bannister's penetration of the four-minute mile mark. Before he ran his sub-four-minute mile in 1954, this feat was considered an impossible barrier that was beyond human physical capabilities. After he ran his so-called magic mile, many other runners suddenly began breaking this once seemingly impossible barrier.
- If you are not reaching your target, it forces you to focus on what you are doing wrong or what you may not be doing that you should. The target holds you to a higher standard of performance.
- Sometimes when people reach their target and nothing happens, they
stop paying attention to whatever the commitment was to get there.
This explains why some people begin to lose after they succeed. They
can't sustain the effort. When someone achieves his goal, the ques-
tion is often, "What now?" My answer, which is based on comparing
athletes who have won gold medals with those who haven't, is to set
up another target that will provide a challenge. The gold medal winners are always stretching for a goal that is uncertain.
- ne trader came to me and said, "When I'm winning, I keep win-
ning—I can do no wrong; when I'm losing, I keep losing—I can't do
anything right." The solution was to create the same state of mind
when he was losing as when he was winning. By getting him to re-create the same mind-set that he has on a winning streak. When he is on a winning streak, he is fearless, intuitive, and makes the right choices. When he is on a losing streak, he needs to visualize, remember, and feel those same positive traits so that
when he comes into the office, he has the same attitude toward his
trading as when he is in the middle of a winning streak. I'm suggesting that people ean re-create that hot streak in their mind.
- I once worked with an ice skater who couldn't do a triple jump.
Every time he attempted the third turn, he would fall. I asked him if
he could begin to do it in his mind. At first, when he attempted
doing it in his mind, he would also fall. I had him keep practicing
the jump in his mind until he felt comlortable doing it mentally. In
order to be able to do it physically on the ice, he had to first have a
mental image of his doing the jump successfully. Not long alter he
became comfortable doing the jump in his mind, he was able to do it
on the ice.
- Define a target, a strategy consistent with the target, a set of disci-
plines to follow, and risk management guidelines. Then trade, track,
and evaluate your performance.
