The Snowball

- In short term, stock market is a voting machine, in the long term, its a weighing machine
- Market valuation is co-related to economic growth.
- Interest rate is to economy as gravity is to physics.
- How people behave is determined by if they’ve got an inner scorecard or an outer scorecard. I always pose it this way,
  would you rather be world’s greatest lover and everyone thinks you are worlds worst lover or vice versa?
- The key is having more information than the other guy, then analyzing it right and "using it rationally".
- Ability to maintain good sales growth, good management, R&D is sign of good business

- Through most of Howard’s final few days, Susie was alone with him, often for hours at a time. She both feared and
  understood pain, but she was unafraid of death and had the strength to sit with Howard even when those around her
  were falling apart. She said. “It was a beautiful experience to be that physically and emotionally intimate with
  someone you loved, because I knew exactly what his needs were. You know when they need to turn their head, or you
  know when they need a little ice chip. You know. You feel it.”

- “Buying Hochschild-Kohn was like the story of a man who buys a yacht,” says Munger. “The two happy days are the day he
   buys it and the day he sells it.”
- Buffett knew that he wanted to be in business with the kind of guy who would leave a black-tie party to count sheets
  of toilet paper; a guy who might screw the guy across the table but never his own partner. He and Rosner shared a
  mutual obsession. As Buffett liked to put it, “Intensity is the price of excellence.”
- See’s had a tentative deal on the table already and wanted $30 million for assets worth $5 million.24 The difference
  was See’s brand, reputation, and trademarks—and most of all. “ its customer goodwill. They decided that See’s was
  like a bond—worth paying $25 million for. If the company had paid out its earnings as “interest,” the interest would
  average about nine percent. That was not enough—owning a business was riskier than owning a bond, and the “interest
  rate” was not guaranteed. But the earnings were growing, on average twelve percent a year. So See’s was like a bond
  whose interest payments grew. Furthermore:
“We thought it had uncapped pricing power. See’s was selling candy for about the price of Russell Stover at the time,
 and the big question in my mind was, if you got another fifteen cents a pound, that was two and a half million dollars
 on top of four million dollars of earnings. So you really were buying something that perhaps could earn six and a half
 or seven million dollars at the time.”
- Christianity has always insisted that the cross we bear comes before the crown we wear
- Buffet did not buy Intel when it was being established, thus passing one of the greatest investments opportunities of
  his life. However, one compromise he would never do was give up his margin of safety for possible riches. Thats what
  made him Warren Buffet.
- While selling a business to Buffet, it was true that Strong willed and ethical entrepreneurs cared more about how the
  new owners will treat them and the company they built, rather than about grabbing last nickel in a sale.
- Time is the friend of the wonderful business, and enemy of the mediocre. It’s far better to buy a wonderful business
  at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price. We look for first class businesses led by first class
  management.
