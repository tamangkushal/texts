The Snowball

- In short term, stock market is a voting machine, in the long term, its a weighing machine
- Market valuation is co-related to economic growth.
- Interest rate is to economy as gravity is to physics.
- How people behave is determined by if they’ve got an inner scorecard or an outer scorecard. I always pose it this way,
  would you rather be world’s greatest lover and everyone thinks you are worlds worst lover or vice versa?
- The key is having more information than the other guy, then analyzing it right and "using it rationally".
- Ability to maintain good sales growth, good management, R&D is sign of good business

- Through most of Howard’s final few days, Susie was alone with him, often for hours at a time. She both feared and
  understood pain, but she was unafraid of death and had the strength to sit with Howard even when those around her
  were falling apart. She said. “It was a beautiful experience to be that physically and emotionally intimate with
  someone you loved, because I knew exactly what his needs were. You know when they need to turn their head, or you
  know when they need a little ice chip. You know. You feel it.”

- “Buying Hochschild-Kohn was like the story of a man who buys a yacht,” says Munger. “The two happy days are the day he
   buys it and the day he sells it.”
- Buffett knew that he wanted to be in business with the kind of guy who would leave a black-tie party to count sheets
  of toilet paper; a guy who might screw the guy across the table but never his own partner. He and Rosner shared a
  mutual obsession. As Buffett liked to put it, “Intensity is the price of excellence.”
- See’s had a tentative deal on the table already and wanted $30 million for assets worth $5 million.24 The difference
  was See’s brand, reputation, and trademarks—and most of all. “ its customer goodwill. They decided that See’s was
  like a bond—worth paying $25 million for. If the company had paid out its earnings as “interest,” the interest would
  average about nine percent. That was not enough—owning a business was riskier than owning a bond, and the “interest
  rate” was not guaranteed. But the earnings were growing, on average twelve percent a year. So See’s was like a bond
  whose interest payments grew. Furthermore:
“We thought it had uncapped pricing power. See’s was selling candy for about the price of Russell Stover at the time,
 and the big question in my mind was, if you got another fifteen cents a pound, that was two and a half million dollars
 on top of four million dollars of earnings. So you really were buying something that perhaps could earn six and a half
 or seven million dollars at the time.”
- Christianity has always insisted that the cross we bear comes before the crown we wear
- Buffet did not buy Intel when it was being established, thus passing one of the greatest investments opportunities of
  his life. However, one compromise he would never do was give up his margin of safety for possible riches. Thats what
  made him Warren Buffet.
- While selling a business to Buffet, it was true that Strong willed and ethical entrepreneurs cared more about how the
  new owners will treat them and the company they built, rather than about grabbing last nickel in a sale.
- Time is the friend of the wonderful business, and enemy of the mediocre. It’s far better to buy a wonderful business
  at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price. We look for first class businesses led by first class
  management.
- Byrne walked through GEICO’s door each morning, sailed his hat fifty feet up to the upper floor of the atrium, and
  hollered hello to the secretaries.59 “If I don’t whistle by the graveyard, who is going to?” he asked. “If I don’t
  dance, who’s going to dance?” He had a way of making people feel tah-riffic about the place where they went to work
  every morning, despite the career-threatening status of their employer. He chopped forty percent of the company’s
  customers, sold half of its profitable life-insurance affiliate to raise cash, and withdrew from all but seven states
  plus the District of Columbia. Byrne seemed to run on rocket fuel.
- The method was the same: Estimate an investment’s intrinsic value, handicap its risk, buy using margin of safety,
  concentrate, stay in the circle of competence, let it roll as compounding did the work. Anyone could understand these
  simple ideas, but even though Buffett made the process look effortless, the technique and discipline underlying it
  involved an enormous amount of work for him and his employees.
- Over your lifetime, you’ll get a reputation for either bluffing or not bluffing. And therefore, I want it to be
  understood that I don’t do it.
- “A reputation is like fine china,” he said, “expensive to acquire, and easily broken.”
- “In essence, one who spends less than he earns is accumulating ‘claim checks’ for future use. At some later date he
   may reverse the procedure and consume more than he earns by cashing some of the accumulated claim checks. Or he may
   pass them on to others—either during his lifetime by gifts, or upon his death by bequest.”
- “some who earned the claim checks passed them along to their heirs, enabling hundreds of descendants to “consume far
   more than they personally have produced; in effect, their whole lifetimes have been spent at the withdrawal window
   of the bank of societal resources.” Buffett found the results ironic.”
- “I love it,” he says, “when I’m around the country club, and I hear people talk about the debilitating aspects of a
   welfare cycle, where some woman had a child at seventeen, and she gets food stamps, and we’re perpetuating a cycle
   of dependency. And these same people are leaving their kids a lifetime supply of food stamps and beyond. But instead
   of having a welfare officer, they have a trust fund officer. And instead of having food stamps, they have stocks and
   bonds that pay dividends.”
- Years earlier Buffett had said he gave his kids a few thousand dollars for Christmas each year and told them to expect
  half a million dollars when he died. That, he thought, was “enough money so that they would feel they could do
  anything, but not so much that they could do nothing.” This phrase would become one of his mantras, repeated over the
  years. “Warren, that’s wrong,” said Larry Tisch, one of his former partners. “If they aren’t spoiled by age twelve,
  they won’t be spoiled.”
- “My kids are going to carve out their own place in the world and they know that I’m for them, whatever they want to
   do,” Buffett said. But “just because they came out of the right womb,” setting them up with a trust fund—which he
   considered “a lifetime supply of food stamps”—could be “harmful” and an “antisocial act.”
