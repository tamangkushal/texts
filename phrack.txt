- Our brains emit "waves". Our brain is nothing but a big antenna, receiving/emitting electro-magnetical energy, as
  waves.
-  Our brains are nothing but wide open wireless access points, emitting signal everywhere around us and receiving
   signals from our environment. Err.. wait.. electro-magnetical brain waves??? WTF man.. But you said our Universe is
   based on electro-magnetism.. If humans can emit electro-magnetical energy this means that.. they can actually affect
   reality? Yes, they do. 
-  But not all antennas have same signal strength; some have stronger signal, some lesser. But all of them modify
   reality according to what they think of reality; some modify reality in a substantial way, that is actually
   noticeable and some others, in a less perceptible way. 
-  If you create an image in your mind, and believe in it strongly and with passion, you will actually make it happen.
   No, it's not esoteric stuff, it's very day-to-day stuff - you don't say any magic spell, you just figure out a way
   to make that image come true. If you REALLY want something and WORK hard so that you DESERVE that certain something,
   there are GREAT chances that the Universe will grant you that something. well, things aren't that easy, really, but
   simplified, that's how it is:
- YOU ARE THE CENTER OF YOUR OWN UNIVERSE. YOU ARE THE MASTERS OF YOUR OWN UNIVERSE. BE TO YOUR OWN UNIVERSE WHAT GOD IS
  TO THE WHOLE UNIVERSE AND TRY TO BE AS MUCH AS GOD AS YOU CAN.

Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) :
————————————————————----------------
- According to Wikipedia, Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a controversial approach to psychotherapy and
  organizational change based on "a model of interpersonal communication chiefly concerned with the relationship
  between successful patterns of behaviour experiences (esp. patterns of thought) underlying them" and "a system of
  alternative therapy based on this which seeks to educate people in self-awareness and effective communication, and to
  change their patterns of mental and emotional behaviour". 
- NLP denotes belief in a connection between neurological processes ('neuro'), language ('linguistic') and behavioral
  patterns that have been learned through experience ('programming').

Why does NLP function ?
—————————————----------
 
- In other words, NLP says that we programmed ourselves to react in a certain way when exposed to certain events. 
- To a hacker, this looks as good as a remote kernel vulnerability with great chances of exploitation. 
- This means that we can trigger a certain reaction or response from someone if we know the conditions (event) that
  would normally lead that person to that reaction by simply tricking the mind into seeing false conditions that would
  lead it to take a decision according to those false conditions.
- A common feature of all contemporary societies is the "guilt syndrome". This arose from the "original sin" trick:
  you're a mere mortal, who deserves to be hurt because a very long time ago, some retard ate an apple. This "guilt
  syndrome" is a very dangerous trap because it makes human beings prone to NLP, as they want to "pay the dues" for
  their "sins". But .. wait .. what if there is no sin?
- "Mommy is feeling very sick today, but I'm sure that if you will bring good grades from school I will be feeling
   better, son" - this is one classical example of how NLP functions. The "Mom" in our case study is faking an illness
   to make her son study harder at school and bring a good grade. In the "son's" mind, he will start feeling guilty for
   his mother's illness, therefore he will force himself to get a good grade, one way or another. In this example, NLP
   is not doing bad to "son" as improving his grades is a good thing. But in the same time, he didn't do what he
   wanted, instead he did what someone else tricked him into doing.
- This worked because we are programed to react like this when feeling guilty

How world uses NLP ?
—————————————-------
- Following what trusted sources tell us is good without questioning and thinking for ourselves, we become slaves of our
  own ignorance.
- Ever since we are little, we rely on others to tell us what's good or bad for us. First, there were the parents &
  family; later, our trusted sources circle gets larger, including our friends and colleagues. When we grow up, we also
  consider mass-media, internet and press as trusted sources, because we are told they are reliable sources that will
  never deceive us. 
- BUT ALL THIS MENTALITY IS BASED ON THE GOOD WILL AND INTENTIONS OF THE TRUSTED SOURCE; WHAT IF THE TRUSTED SOURCE
  SLIGHTLY MODIFIES THE INFORMATION SENT TO US (just like in NLP case studies), JUST TO TRIGGER A CERTAIN BEHAVIORAL
  PATTERN FROM US?

NLP in social engineering: 
——————————————------------
- The best example that comes to my mind is that of an imaginary hacker character, let's call it The_COnd®r, who breaks
  into one of the largest telco in the country through social engineering.
- The trick with social engineering is to make your peer STRONGLY BELIEVE into a fake reality you are feeding him. You
  just need to make that "reality" as accurate as possible so he doesn't realise it's a trick. 
- And this is exactly when NLP steps into place. First of all, you need to adopt a similar posture to your target
  (not physical necessarily). For instance, if you are targeting an employee, act as an employee who is in big trouble,
  make him to be a part of your dramatic situations happening to others they usually think "oh, fuck this could happen
  to me aswell" and they will give you that password.
- A real life example, this time, comes from the Middle East. During the recent war between Israel and Lebanon, the
  Hamass posted on the Internet images of crippled or killed children, dismembered, etc. This ofcourse, had a huge
  impact on the international community and a lot of countries and important people took position and asked Israel to
  stop the war. But after all, it was just a good press campaign organised by the Hamass, manipulating the media and
  the society.
- The point is that by EXPLOITING HUMAN BEING IGNORANCE AND CONFORT IN TRUSTING WHAT THEY CONSIDER AS BEING "TRUSTED
  SOURCES" OR BY FAKING A SOURCE MAKING IT LOOK TRUSTWORTHY, YOU CAN TRICK PEOPLE INTO ACTING AGAINST THEMSELVES, AND
  SURPRISINGLY, BE HAPPY ABOUT IT.

The chain remains
——————————-------
- Slavery is long gone, most people think. Just because the chains don't ring anymore as we walk, it doesn't mean they
  disappeared.
- It's just that today chains have been more subtle and harder to perceive. 
- The society, through its members, or mass-media, or tv networks, books, religion, banking system and it's loans, and
  so on,EVERYTHING is keeping us bonded to these chains we hate so much. 
- By telling us how we should behave in certain conditions because that's "normal", by feeding us distorted information
  aimed to harden the concept of "normal" and "what we should do", by creating fake needs, desires and dreams we become
  addicted to the society and less aware of our real selves.
- The society is feeding you models, driving expensive cars, living in big houses, living the good life, you know.
  Automatically, in your mind you start to want the same (because society taught us that second place is for the
  losers), so you get deeper into it. 
- You contract a loan from the bank just to get a bigger house, or a faster car. You start to work extra-hours just to
  impress your boss enough to promote you: a promotion would allow you to buy more things. 
- Unknowingly, you become bonded to the system, without the possibility of escaping from it. 
- You become a slave of your work/bank just to satisfy your NEEDS. But these are not real needs, instead it's what your
  TRUSTED SOURCES told you you need. 
- If you want to break loose of the chains holding you down, you need to ACCEPT. You need to accept what is happening to
  you, either it being "good" or "bad". 
- The Universe and Its Laws don't think in terms of duality, but Unicity. You need to understand that EVERYTHING
  HAPPENING TO YOU IS THE RESULT OF YOUR PREVIOUS ACTIONS AND THAT YOU ONLY GOT HERE WHERE YOU ARE AS A RESULT OF YOUR
  CHOICES. 
-  You need to understand that TO OBTAIN SOMETHING FIRST YOU MUST DESERVE that thing and that there are no shortcuts in
   life.
-  "Any competition is the entertainment of the rulers at the expense of the slaves"
