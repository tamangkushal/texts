# Benjamin Cowen
----------------
----------------

- only when the dogs(BTC)'s away, the cats (ETH) will play, and when cats away, the mice (ALTS) will play
- (TOTAL3-USDT)/BTC <- "this chart oscillates from 1 to 0.25"
- BTC.D*TOTAL/(TOTAL-USDC-USDT-BVB_DLY:DAI-GLASSNODE:BUSD_MARKETCAP) <- "BTC dominance excluding stables"
- stick to BTC, because bitcoin dominance goes up until post-halving year
- when you want to dunk on other peoples views because you were right, and they were wrong, its time to change your own
  views
- higher highs means there is strength to the rally, lower highs in a bull market support band means it might not hold
  because there is weakness in lower highs

# picking an altcoin
——————————-----------
- To pick an altcoin in alt-season, look for altcoins that double bottomed in ALT/BTC chart, like SOL/BTC, AAVE/BTC
- However, a lot of altcoins last cycle bottomed after QE began
- If QE begins, and they keep bleeding, then its likely to be a relic
- Best alt coins : Cardano, Polkadot, 
- Guy altcoins: Atom (cosmos), algorand, aave, ada

# bull market support band
———————————————-----------
- 20W SMA & 21W EMA

# Bottoms(2024 halving year):
-----------------------------
- MATIC/BTC to bottom out at 800-900 sats ADA/BTC to bottom at 400-500 sats AVAX/BTC to go in 3000 range Polladot might
  be a relic. It already bleed too much

# Predictions (2024 halving year)
----------------------------------
- BTC dominance to grind higher in 2024,rally starting as early as August, top maybe on September-January, Dec if have
  to pick 1 month, and to fall in 2025
- ALT/BTC pairs fell 1 month before FED rate cut last cycle, and may do the same this cycle, falling starting August if
  FED cut rates in September 
- ETH/BTC pair fell on the month that the FED cut rates. There is a FED FOMC meeting in sep 18,2024
- If above happens, ALT/BTC bottoms in November and ETH/BTC bottoms in December 

If Fed cuts in October:
- ALT/BTC starts to fall in Sep, bottoms in Nov/Dec
- ETH/BTC starts to fall in Oct, bottoms in Dec/Jan

# TSLA
-------
- tsla will pull back to Bull market support bank, and then go higher
- eventually TSLA will go to all time highs
- Previous consolidation phase  was 170 weeka long, if we have similar consolidation phase, it takes us to 2026
- buy it when it goes down 
- [dec 10] TSLA breaks $400. If TSLA continues to do what it did in 2016-17, it could get a pulllback below $400, before
  moving to 600$ in 2025, the 1.618 Fib retracement level

# MSTR buying crazy Bitcoin in 2024
———————————————————-----------------
- MSTR buying bitcoin (17B in 30days) has been a tailwind for Bitcoin in 2024, pushing the prices above 100k, but it can
  be a headwind for Bitcoin in 2025, when people will see the risk that one entity buying has pushed the prices so
  high, and they might go into altcoins which do not have the same single entity risk, which could fuel the Alt season
  in 2025

# ETH/BTC
——————------
- In QT bull market, B outperforms E
- In QE bull market, E outperforms B
- ETH USD historically bottoms during december

- ADA/BTC historic range lows is around 400 SATS
